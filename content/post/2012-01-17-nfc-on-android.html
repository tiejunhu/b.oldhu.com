<h3>What's NFC</h3>

<ul>
    <li>NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically requiring a distance of 4 cm or less.</li>
    <li>NFC operates at 13.56â€¯MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s.</li>
    <li>NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive target.</li>
    <li>NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.</li>
    <li>There is no link level encryption built into NFC</li>
</ul>


<h3>On Android</h3>

<ul>
    <li>NFC allows you to share small payloads of data between an NFC tag and an Android-powered device, or between two Android-powered devices. </li>
    <li>Android framework APIs are based around a NFC Forum standard called **NDEF** (NFC Data Exchange Format).</li>
    <li>On Android NFC is off when the screen is off (no butt sniffing)</li>
    <li>No API support for card emulation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supported Tag Technology</h3>

It is <b>mandatory</b> for all Android NFC devices to support the following tags:
<table>
<tr><th>Class</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>NfcA</td><td>Provides access to NFC-A (ISO 14443-3A) properties and I/O operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NfcB</td><td>Provides access to NFC-B (ISO 14443-3B) properties and I/O operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NfcF</td><td>Provides access to NFC-F (JIS 6319-4) properties and I/O operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NfcV</td><td>Provides access to NFC-V (ISO 15693) properties and I/O operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>IsoDep</td><td>Provides access to ISO-DEP (ISO 14443-4) properties and I/O operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ndef</td><td>Provides access to NDEF data and operations on NFC tags that have been formatted as NDEF. Support NFC Forum Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4 compliant tags</td></tr>
</table>

The following tag technologies are optionally supported:
<table>
<tr><th>Class</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>MifareClassicProvides</td><td>access to MIFARE Classic properties and I/O operations, if this Android device supports MIFARE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MifareUltralight</td><td>Provides access to MIFARE Ultralight properties and I/O operations, if this Android device supports MIFARE.</td></tr>
</table>
